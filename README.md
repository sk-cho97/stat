## shape of my heart - sting
> He deals the cards as a meditation And those he plays never suspect He doesn't play for the money he wins He don't play for respect
>
> He deals the cards to find the answer The sacred geometry of chance The hidden law of a probable outcome The numbers lead a dance
>
> I know that the spades are the swords of a soldier I know that the clubs are weapons of war I know that diamonds mean money for this art But that's not the shape of my heart
>
> He may play the Jack of diamonds He may lay the Queen of spades He may conceal a King in his hand While the memory of it fades
>
> I know that the spades are the swords of a soldier I know that the clubs are weapons of war I know that diamonds mean money for this art But that's not the shape of my heart
